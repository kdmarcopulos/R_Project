# R_Project

The objective of our project is to predict a points total based on a few offensive features. The data used is sourced from Wyscout and incorporates metrics from the top 5 European leagues from the 2015/16 season through the 2020/21 season. The 2019/20 Ligue 1 season was omitted because it was halted without resumption due to COVID.

The features we used to predict Points are Total Shots, Shot % on Target, and Total Touches in Penalty Area.
